I am a second year PhD student in Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at the University of California, San Diego, advised by Prof. [Yang Zheng](https://zhengy09.github.io/). Previously, I received my bachelor degree in Bio-industrial Mechatronics Engineering, National Chung Hsing University, and master degree in ECE at the University of California, San Diego.

- [Feb. 2025] Check out our new work [Inexact Augmented Lagrangian Methods for Conic Programs: Quadratic Growth and Linear Convergence.](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2024/file/480eb35745feb11c9120b666f640893e-Paper-Conference.pdf)                    

- Our paper on [Inexact Augmented Lagrangian Methods for Conic Programs: Quadratic Growth and Linear Convergence](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.22683) has been accepted to NeurIPS 2024. In this paper, we analyze the error bound condition for semidefinite programs (SDPs) from the perspective of exact penalty functions, and show linear convergence of the primal iterate of the Augmented Lagrangian method for SDPs.

- Presented a talk on [Error bounds, PL condition, and quadratic growth for weakly convex
functions, and linear convergences of proximal point methods](https://fengyiliao.github.io/files/2024-ISMP-Liao.pdf) at [2024 ISMP conference](https://ismp2024.gerad.ca/).

- Our paper on [Error bounds, PL condition, and quadratic growth for weakly convex
functions, and linear convergences of proximal point methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16775) has been accepted for presentation at the 2024 L4DC!

- Presented a talk on [An Overview and Comparison of Spectral Bundle Methods for
Primal and Dual Semidefinite Programs](https://fengyiliao.github.io/files/2024-IOS-Liao.pdf) at [2024 IOS conference](https://ios2024.rice.edu/).

- Received the **Informs 2023 poster presentation award** - Operations Research and Optimization Methodologies Category Winner.
